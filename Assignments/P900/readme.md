## Brick Wall Patterns (900)
### Nathan Van De Vyvere

### Description: 
If we want to build a brick wall out of the usual size
of brick which has a length twice as long as its height,
and if our wall is to be two units tall, we can make our
wall in a number of patterns, depending on how long
we want it. From the figure one observe that:

• There is just one wall pattern which is 1 unit wide

— made by putting the brick on its end.

• There are 2 patterns for a wall of length 2: two
side-ways bricks laid on top of each other and two
bricks long-ways up put next to each other.

• There are three patterns for walls of length 3.
How many patterns can you find for a wall of length 4? And, for a wall of length 5?
Your task is to write a program that given the length of a wall, determines how many patterns there
may be for a wall of that length.
