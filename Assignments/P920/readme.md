## Sunny Mountains (920)
### Nathan Van De Vyvere

### Description: 
During their honeymoon, Mrs and Mr Smith went to the Himalayas. How they were surprised when
they observed that, during the sunset, all the snow touched by the sunbeams turned red.
Such a magnificent landscape leaves everyone plenty of emotion, but Mr Smith’s number obsession
overcame all this. He rapidly began evaluating distances, which made Mrs Smith quite upset.
Your work is to help him calculate the size, in meters, of the mountainsides that became red as the
sun sets. Mr Smith’s honeymoon depends on you! Please be quick and efficient.
For the sake of simplicity, consider that, during the sunset, the sunbeams are horizontal and assume
that the landscape is described by the set of coordinates of the mountain peaks and cols. This can be
depicted by the following figure. A landscape, in this context, is then a sequence of peaks and cols (i.e.,
only a col follows a peak and conversely).

Note that, in this picture, the sunny mountainsides are emphasized by bold lines and the coordinates
of the landscape are emphasized by bold points.
Thus, the goal of this problem is to calculate the total length in meters of the bold lines.
For this task consider that: (1) for all coordinates (x, y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 30000 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 8848; (2)
the unit is the meter; (3) all the X-coordinates are pair-wise distinct; (4) the leftmost point has 0 as
X-coordinate and the rightmost point has 0 as Y-coordinate; (5) The total number of coordinates given
is n ≤ 100.
