## Place the Guards (11080)
### Nathan Van De Vyvere

### Description: 
In the country of Ajabdesh there are some streets and junctions.
Each street connects 2 junctions. The king of Ajabdesh wants to
place some guards in some junctions so that all the junctions and
streets can be guarded by them. A guard in a junction can guard
all the junctions and streets adjacent to it. But the guards themselves are not gentle. If a street is guarded by multiple guards
then they start fighting. So the king does not want the scenario
where a street may be guarded by two guards. Given the information about the streets and junctions of Ajabdesh, help the king
to find the minimum number of guards needed to guard all the
junctions and streets of his country.
