## Maximum Sum (108)
### Nathan Van De Vyvere

### Description: 
A problem that is simple to solve in one dimension is often much more difficult to solve in more than
one dimension. Consider satisfying a boolean expression in conjunctive normal form in which each
conjunct consists of exactly 3 disjuncts. This problem (3-SAT) is NP-complete. The problem 2-SAT
is solved quite efficiently, however. In contrast, some problems belong to the same complexity class
regardless of the dimensionality of the problem.
Given a 2-dimensional array of positive and negative integers, find the sub-rectangle with the largest
sum. The sum of a rectangle is the sum of all the elements in that rectangle. In this problem the subrectangle
with the largest sum is referred to as the maximal sub-rectangle.
