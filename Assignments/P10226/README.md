## Hardwood Species (10226)
### Nathan Van De Vyvere

### Description: 
Hardwoods are the botanical group of trees that have broad leaves,
produce a fruit or nut, and generally go dormant in the winter.
America’s temperate climates produce forests with hundreds of
hardwood species —trees that share certain biological characteristics.
Although oak, maple and cherry all are types of hardwood trees, for
example, they are different species. Together, all the hardwood species
represent 40 percent of the trees in the United States.
On the other hand, softwoods, or conifers, from the Latin word
meaning “cone-bearing”, have needles. Widely available US softwoods
include cedar, fir, hemlock, pine, redwood, spruce and cypress. In a
home, the softwoods are used primarily as structural lumber such as
2×4s and 2×6s, with some limited decorative applications.
Using satellite imaging technology, the Department of Natural Resources has compiled an inventory
of every tree standing on a particular day. You are to compute the total fraction of the tree population
represented by each species.
